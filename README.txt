Run code in Google Colab, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Google Colab in your web browser.
2. Click on "File" in the top menu and select "Upload notebook" to upload the notebook file.
3. Upload the mumbai.csv file.
4. Upload the AIDS_Classification_5000.csv file.
5. Run the code.



Important Note: I have used Google Colab to run the code. My machine had trouble installing deps. 
Please use this link to run the code: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ojecPIcS7Vd5VAoIjEc8Ihn8dnjCRYyR?usp=sharing

I have also attached .ipynb file in the repo. You can download and run it in your local machine.

## 2. Local installation

To run the code on your local machine, you can install Jupyter Notebook or any other code editor that supports Python. You will also need to install the following libraries:

1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Scikit-learn
6. XGBoost
7. LightGBM
8. CatBoost

You can install these libraries using pip

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm catboost
```

After installing the required libraries, you can run the code in your local machine.
